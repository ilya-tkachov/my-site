            I'm a product-oriented software engineer. I've dedicated my whole
            life talking to users and shipping iteratively with AI. I'm great at
            greenfield or growth projects, and figuring out what the customer
            will actually pay for. If this sounds like someone you're really
            excited about working with, then <Link

            Co-founded a social platform for artists (think Patreon/Gumroad but
            for artists) and grew it to 10,000 monthly users, learning about the
            creator marketplace and building one of the best video and image
            browsing experiences.
